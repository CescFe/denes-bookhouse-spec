## üìåAbstract
This project is a solution to the OneBox Software Engineer technical test. 
It involves simulating the functionality of an e-commerce system.
To achieve this we implement a RESTful API using clean architecture principles to manage `Product` and `Cart` entities. 
The API supports CRUD operations for both entities while adhering to industry standards and best practices, such as `API-first development`, validation, robust error handling and testing.

## üîéTechnologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java 21 üçµ
- **Framework:** Spring Boot 3.4.0 (Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Hibernate) üçÉ
- **Database:** H2 (In-memory database) üîã
- **Build Tool:** Maven ü™∂
- **API Specification:** OpenAPI (openapi-generator-maven-plugin)
- **Validation:** Hibernate Validator (Jakarta Validation API)
- **Testing:** JUnit 5, MockMvc ü™≤
- **Postman:** A workspace is created (for demo and manual testing) 
- **GitHub Workflows:** Added an Action to validate Pull Requests
- **Docker:** optional for an easier deployment üêã

## üí°Approach to the Solution
1. **API-First Design:**
    - Defined endpoints and data models using OpenAPI specifications.
    - Autogenerated DTOs and interfaces using `openapi-generator-maven-plugin`.

2. **Hexagonal Architecture:**
    - Divided the project into `application`, `domain`, and `infrastructure` layers for better maintainability and separation of concerns.
    - Used ports and adapters to decouple business logic from infrastructure.
    - Applied [Vertical Slice](https://www.jimmybogard.com/vertical-slice-architecture/) to minimize coupling between Products and Carts.

3. **Entity Relationships:**
    - Implemented a `Product` entity, representing individual items in the catalog.
    - Designed a `Cart` entity with a `ManyToMany` relationship with `Product`, allowing multiple products to belong to multiple carts.

4. **Validation and Error Handling:**
    - Applied constraints at the OpenAPI Specification level for data validation.
    - Used a `GlobalExceptionHandler` for consistent error responses.

5. **Testing:**
    - Developed integration tests for the endpoints using MockMvc.
    - Verified data persistence with H2 and tested invalid scenarios.

6. **Incremental Development:**
    - Followed an iterative approach by first implementing `Api`, then `Product` functionality and last extending it to `Cart`.

## ‚è≥Pending Topics

1. **Improve Test Coverage:**
   - Expand unit tests to cover edge cases more comprehensively.
   - Add integration tests to improve bad path coverage. 

2. **Security:**
    - Authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., JWT) are not implemented.

3. **Caching:**
   - Introduce in-memory caching (e.g., Caffeine) for frequently accessed data like product details.

4. **API Documentation UI:**
    - UI integration for interactive API documentation (e.g.: Swagger UI, Stoplight, Redocly).

5. **OpenAPI Refactor:**
   - Refactor `e-commerce.yaml` extracting and reusing schemas, responses, requests and errors.


## ‚úèÔ∏èPossible Improvements

1. **Testing Enhancements:**
    - Include contract tests to validate API compatibility with consumers.
    - Include a Quality Assurance folder to test in depth the use cases.

2. **Monitoring:**
    - Integrate tools like Prometheus and Grafana for performance monitoring and alerting.

3. **API Versioning:**
    - Introduce versioning to maintain backward compatibility.

4. **API Decouple:**
    - Extract OpenApi generation and data into a spec repository.

5. **Data Persistence:**
    - Transition from H2 to a production-grade database (e.g.: PostgreSQL or MySQL).

6. **CI/CD:**
   - Add environments and GitHub Actions to improve the CI/CD

## üöÄHow to Run the Application

1. **Requirements**:
   - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/FrancescFe/oneboxchallenge.git
   cd oneboxchallenge
   ```
3. **Build the Project and Run the Application:**
   ```
   docker compose up -d
   ```
4. **Access the API:**
   - The Application runs at `http://localhost:8080`
   - [Postman workspace](https://www.postman.com/material-operator-40700101/workspace/onebox-challenge) created for testing/demo purpose
